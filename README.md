# [zoomTV](zoomtv.live)
This repo contains the client-side code for [zoomTV](zoomtv.live). For server-side code, take a look our other [repo](https://github.com/rishi-tripathy/zoom-tv-server).

## What is zoomTV?
The new channel surfing of the internet! zoomTV helps you share and find great Zoom events, meetings, and get-togethers.

## Adding an Event
To add your event to zoomTV, just invite our friendly service bot to your Zoom calendar event: [zoom-tv-guide@appspot.gserviceaccount.com](zoom-tv-guide@appspot.gserviceaccount.com).

Make sure to leave the default Zoom description for your event so we can parse the Zoom link :), but feel free to write your own event description above the default one... and include hashtags to tag your events!

## Reporting Events
zoomTV at its core aims to build a sense of community. If you feel a Zoom event has been innappropriately shared on zoomTV, simply click the "Report" flag button on the event's card. This will notify zoomTV admins who will triage the issue and remove the event if necessary.

## Extra Feature List
- Clean reporting and removal workflow for problematic Zoom events
- Rich search
- Easy integration with calendars and Zoom
- Live-event detection and ability to immediately join
- Automatic Zoom link, description, and tag parsing
